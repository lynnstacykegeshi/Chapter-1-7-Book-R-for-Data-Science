# Illustration of R Markdown Features

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

# Illustrating Inline elements


# Illustrating Block-level elements


# Illustrating Mathematical Expressions
Once in a while we have to write some mathematical expressions

1.The formular can be left inside the textto look as follows $x + y = 30$
2. If we want the formular to be on the next line we can: $$x+y-30$$
3. We can also use latex notation to present mathematical formulation.
$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{e^x}{3x}+4x^2 \, dx$$
